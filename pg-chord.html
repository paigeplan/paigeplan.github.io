    <h1> PG chord </h1>
    <p>The code lives here: <a href="https://github.com/paigeplan/music158_cap_keyboard">https://github.com/paigeplan/music158_cap_keyboard</a>. I had originally made the instrument to work with only with a Max patch that I had made a while back, but now it is a general MIDI controller with polyphonic aftertouch, pitch bend, CC, and sensitivity control. Right now, I've been using chorded button combinations to select between different presets and scales. My main reason for making it was to have something I could easily program for any application. I used a Teensy 3.1, which I highly recommend for any USB MIDI projects.</p>
    <p> Here's a song I made with it:</p>
    <audio src="two_p.mp3" controls>    
    <p>Sound file cannot be played</p>
    </audio>

    <p> Here's a video of it in action</p>

    <p>And here is a video of the copper part being milled out. I used an Othermill, and made the file with Eagle.</p>
