    <p>I designed and milled a PCB for this one too. I found the schematic from this website: <a href="http://www.generalguitargadgets.com/effects-projects/octave/dan-armstrong-green-ringer/">http://www.generalguitargadgets.com/effects-projects/octave/dan-armstrong-green-ringer/</a></p>

    <p>My first PCB design was uneccessarily big, but I only realized that until after I milled it.</p><img src="images/pedals/green_ringer/green_ringer_milling1.PNG" style="max-width:80%" alt="PCB being made in an Othermill. This was my first attempt and it was too large to fit an enclosure." />

    <p>Later I made a more sensibly sized one.</p>

    A video I took of the milling process: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWC9TfbezAU&t=7s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWC9TfbezAU&t=7s</a></p>

    <p>Here it is all assembled. I drilled the enclosure this time.</p>

<p>I also perf-boarded this one.</p>

    <p> If you'd like to mill your own, you can use my .brd file I uploaded here: <a href="https://github.com/paigeplan/green_ringer">https://github.com/paigeplan/rangemaster</a>. </p>
