    <h1>Rangemaster Treble Booster</h1>
    
    <p>I got the schematic for this pedal fuzzcentral's site (<a href="http://fuzzcentral.ssguitar.com/rangemaster.php">http://fuzzcentral.ssguitar.com/rangemaster.php</a>) Instead of making it on perf board, I created a PCB layout in Eagle so that I could mill it out with my school's PCB miller.</p>
    <p>Here's what it looks like in Eagle. You first create a schematic to specify how each component should be electrically connected, then you switch to the another mode to layout how the board should be physically laid out. </p>

 <p>
    I then uploaded that file to this milling machine (this one is an Othermill), which milled and drilled a blank copper board into the PCB I designed.  </p>

<p>
    And here is that same PCB populated with components. I later added a light. </p>

<p> If you'd like to mill your own, you can use my .brd file I uploaded here: <a href="https://github.com/paigeplan/rangemaster">https://github.com/paigeplan/rangemaster</a>. </p>
