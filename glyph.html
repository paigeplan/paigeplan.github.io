    <h1>Glyph</h1>

    This app was my first programming project I did on my own time. My older brother used PECS cards at the time, along with an app that did pretty much the same thing as this one, except only worked on iPad. I decided to make this so my Mom could bring something similar around on her phone. He uses a whole different system for communicating now, though.</p>
